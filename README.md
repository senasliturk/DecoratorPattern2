Recall the exercise from our Lecture-4 about the Decorator Pattern. Write the cost( ) methods for the
following classes (pseudo-Java is okay):
public class Beverage {
// declare instance variables for milkCost,
// soyCost, mochaCost, and whipCost, and
// getters and setters for milk, soy, mocha
// and whip.
public double cost() {
FILL THIS PART
}
}
public class DarkRoast extends Beverage {
public DarkRoast() {
description = “Most Excellent Dark Roast”;
}
public double cost() {
FILL THIS PART
}
}
